# SublimeText - File History #

A plugin to provide access to the history of accessed files - project-wise or globally. Stores a JSON file with the file history.
**Sublime Text 3 compatible**.

Obtained from [https://gist.github.com/1133602][gist] by Josh Bjornson.


**Note**: I tried checking for file existence in the history but this took more time than expected (especially with networked files) and made the plugin quite unresponsive. The compromise is a command to cleanup the current project (with the option to clean up the global list as well). The cleanup will remove any files in the project history that don't exist.

## Installation ##

**With [Package Control][pck-ctrl]**: Once installed, bring up the Command Palette (`Command-Shift-P` on OS X, `Ctrl-Shift-P` on Linux/Windows). Select `Package Control: Install Package` and then select `File History` when the list appears. Package Control will automagically keep the plugin up to date with the latest version.

**Without Git**: Download the latest source from [GitHub][github] ([.zip][zipball]) and copy the folder to your Sublime Text "Packages" directory (you might want to rename it to "File History" before).

**With Git**: Clone the repository in a subfolder "File History" in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:

    git clone git://github.com/FichteFoll/sublimetext-filehistory.git


The "Packages" directory (for ST2) is located at:

* Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/`
* OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`

Or enter
```python
sublime.packages_path()
```
into the console (`` Ctrl-` ``).


## Usage ##

To run the plugin, enter the following into the console:
```python
view.run_command("open_recently_closed_file")
```

For default keymap definitions, see [Default.sublime-keymap][keymap] ([OSX][keymap-osx]).
